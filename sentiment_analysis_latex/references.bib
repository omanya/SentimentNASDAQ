A Bayesian bootstrap procedure implies that an investor with prior belief 0.5 that expected returns on the equal-weighted index are never negative comes away from the full-period B/M evidence with posterior probability 0.08 for the hypothesis (0.14 with the impact of the 1933 outlier tempered). Although this raises doubts about market efficiency, the post-1940 evidence is consistent with expected returns always being positive.}

The DJIA book-to-market ratio contains information about future returns that is not captured by other variables such as interest yield spreads and dividend yields. The DJIA book-to-market ratios predictive ability is specific to the pre-1960 sample. In contrast, the S&P book-to-market ratio provides some predictive ability in the post-1960 period, although this relation is dramatically weaker than the Dow Jones pre-1960 findings. The predictive ability of book-to-market ratios appears to stem from the relation between book value and future earnings.}

The findings show that the influence of investor sentiment is significant from 1month to 24months. Its effect is asymmetric and reversal, that is, it is positive and large for stocks with high returns in the short term while negative and small in the long term. This reversal effect verifies the existence of a strong overreaction in the Chinese stock market. We also find that Chinese investors have notable cognitive bias and speculation tendency.}

abstract ={We employ quantile regression to provide a detailed picture of the stock return forecasting ability of investor sentiment. We find that investor sentiment predicts aggregate stock returns at lower quantiles. However, the forecasting power is lost at upper quantiles. The results are robust after controlling for a comprehensive set of macroeconomic and financial predictors and for characteristic portfolios. We also show that investor sentiment consists mainly of cash flow news and contains little information about discount rate news. The ability to forecast cash flows increases gradually from the lower quantiles to upper quantiles. Our results do not support that the ability of investor sentiment to predict stock returns comes from a rational forecast of future cash flows.}

Overall, our findings are broadly consistent with most behavioural theories and show that sentiment mainly affects the valuation of assets in extreme market conditions.}

Consistent with previous findings, negative words, rather than those expressing other types of sentiment, statistically significantly affect adjusted returns and detrended trading volumes. However, extending previous studies, the results of this paper indicate that shareholders’ decisions are mainly guided by the negative sentiment in listed companies’ announcements rather than that in journalists’ stories. Furthermore, this effect is restricted to the announcement day. The average market reaction–measured by adjusted returns–is inversely related only when the announcements are ignored by the media, but the dispersion of market reaction–measured by detrended trading volume–is positively affected only when announcements are followed up by journalists.}

Traditional economic theories are inadequate for interpreting market responses driven by people’s subjective thinking, as these cognitive processes are not encompassed by the concept of utility. We explore these effects by using computational linguistics and deep structured learning algorithms to analyze financial newspapers and social media posts. After controlling for factors related to content and market momentum in our narrative based credibility indicator, we find that news credibility is positively correlated with the returns on assets preferred by experts and negatively correlated with assets preferred by gamblers. Based on this finding, we point out that the efficient-market hypothesis (EMH) is not appropriate in the dominant market of gamblers in the short-term. In the long-term, however, investment motivation does not significantly affect the validity of the hypothesis.}

Accuracy levels are similar to widely used Bayes classifiers, but false positives are lower and sentiment accuracy higher. Time series and cross-sectional aggregation of message information improves the quality of the resultant sentiment index, particularly in the presence of slang and ambiguity. Empirical applications evidence a relationship with stock values—tech-sector postings are related to stock index levels, and to volumes and volatility. The algorithms may be used to assess the impact on investor opinion of management announcements, press releases, third-party news, and regulatory changes. }

An alternative view is that risk is increasing in the BTM ratio. This paper confirms that the BTM effect is related to earnings disappointments. However, it is posited that the association of the BTM ratio with subsequent return stems from its ability to predict the price reaction to an earnings disappointment rather than its predictive ability for earnings disappointments per se. Specifically, accounting valuation models suggest that the price of low BTM stocks is sensitive to earnings disappointments while that of high BTM stocks is not. Evidence consistent with this prediction is provided. Fundamental valuation reasons and not differential optimism underlie the BTM ratio’s ability to predict return.}

We demonstrate that a transparent and replicable approach significantly outperforms standard dictionary-based methods used in the literature while remaining competitive with more complex machine learning algorithms. Aggregating individual message sentiment at half-hour intervals, we provide empirical evidence that online investor sentiment helps forecast intraday stock index returns. After controlling for past market returns, we find that the first half-hour change in investor sentiment predicts the last half-hour S&P 500 index ETF return. Examining users’ self-reported investment approach, holding period and experience level, we find that the intraday sentiment effect is driven by the shift in the sentiment of novice traders. Overall, our results provide direct empirical evidence of sentiment-driven noise trading at the intraday level.}

The construction of sentiment variables in network- and dictionary-based messages is more precise and variable than that in traditional-based messages. Our results show that firms with investors' optimistic sentiments have significantly higher stock returns in the current month, whereas those with pessimistic sentiments have significantly opposite effects. The effect of both investors' optimism and pessimism on stock returns subsequently reverses. Then, the negative impacts of investors' largely pessimistic sentiments on stock returns are larger than the positive impacts of their largely optimistic sentiments within a quarter. Next, investors' optimistic sentiments significantly raise stock return volatility by approximately a quarter, but their pessimistic sentiments have the opposite effects. Furthermore, investors' high optimism more significantly and persistently raises stock return volatility than their general optimism, but the negative effects of their high pessimism on volatility become smaller and the persistence is shorter than general pessimism. In addition to the advantage of our methodology in creating sentiment variables, the simultaneous consideration of investors' optimism and pessimism to analyze the effects on the returns and the volatility of individual stocks in this study is more complete than previous related studies.}

 abstract = {This study investigates whether the ability of book-to-market to predict returns derives from systematic errors in the market's expectation of future earnings. We extend Beaver and Ryan [1996; 2000] by decomposing book-to-market into a more persistent (bias) component and a delayed recognition (lag) component. We find that both components are related to analyst expectations of future earnings, but the lag component is the dominant factor across all forecast horizons. Similarly, we find that the lag component explains most of the inverse relation between book-to-market and future returns. Given that lag is constructed by regressing book-to-market ratios on lagged price changes, our results are consistent with the lag component capturing systematic stock price reversals. We find that the components have unique relations with subsequent earnings forecast revisions, and controlling for these relations substantially mitigates the components' ability to predict returns. Our component-level analysis provides insight into how expected future earnings, summarized in book-to-market ratios help to explain this market anomaly.},

The conditional variance of returns is a combination of jumps and smoothly changing components. A heterogeneous Poisson process with a time-varying conditional intensity parameter governs the likelihood of jumps. Unlike typical jump models with stochastic volatility, previous realizations of both jump and normal innovations can feed back asymmetrically into expected volatility. This model improves forecasts of volatility, particularly after large changes in stock returns. We provide empirical evidence of the impact and feedback effects of jump versus normal return innovations, leverage effects, and the time-series dynamics of jump clustering.},

Furthermore, the inclusion of the news variable in the conditional variance equation of the generalized autoregressive conditional heteroscedastic model also reduces volatility persistence, especially with intraday data.

Our model is asymmetric and helps to explain the negative skewness and excess kurtosis of U.S. monthly and daily stock returns over the period 1926–1988.

We expect earnings announcements to reduce differences of opinion among investors, and consequently, these announcements should reduce overvaluation. Using five distinct proxies for differences of opinion, we find that high differences of opinion stocks earn significantly lower returns around earnings announcements than low differences of opinion stocks. In addition, the returns on high differences of opinion stocks are more negative within the subsample of stocks that are most difficult for investors to sell short. These results are robust when we control for the size effect and the market-to-book effect and when we examine alternative explanations such as financial leverage, earnings announcement premium, post-earnings announcement drift, return momentum, and potential biases in analysts’ forecasts. Also consistent with Miller's theory, we find that stocks subject to high differences of opinion and more binding short-sales constraints have a price run-up just prior to earnings announcements that is followed by an even larger decline after the announcements.}

These asymmetric least squares estimators have properties which are analogous to regression quantile estimators, but are much simpler to calculate, as are the corresponding test statistics. The coefficient estimators can be used to construct test statistics for homoskedasticity and conditional symmetry of the error distribution, and we find these tests compare quite favorably with other commonly-used tests of these null hypotheses in terms of local relative efficiency. Consequently, asymmetric least squares estimation provides a convenient and relatively efficient method of summarizing the conditional distribution of a dependent variable given the regressors, and a means of testing whether a linear model is an adequate characterization of the "typical value" for this conditional distribution.},

    abstract = { Recent interest in modern regression modelling has focused on extending available (mean) regression models by describing more general properties of the response distribution. An alternative approach is quantile regression where regression effects on the conditional quantile function of the response are assumed. While quantile regression can be seen as a generalization of median regression, expectiles as alternative are a generalized form of mean regression.Generally, quantiles provide a natural interpretation even beyond the 0.5 quantile, the median. A comparable simple interpretation is not available for expectiles beyond the 0.5 expectile, the mean. Nonetheless, expectiles have some interesting properties, some of which are discussed in this article. We contrast the two approaches and show how to get quantiles from a fine grid of expectiles. We compare such quantiles from expectiles with direct quantile estimates regarding efficiency. We also look at regression problems where both quantile and expectile curves have the undesirable property that neighbouring curves may cross each other. We propose a modified method to estimate non-crossing expectile curves based on splines. In an application, we look at the expected shortfall, a risk measure used in finance, which requires both expectiles and quantiles for estimation and which can be calculated easily with the proposed methods in the article. }

    abstract = { This paper considers the nonparametric estimation of regression expectiles and percentiles by using an asymmetric least squares (ALS) approach, in which the squared error loss function is given different weights depending on whether thc residual is positive or negative. The kernel method based on locally linear fit is adopted, which also provides an estimator of the derivative of the regression function. Under the assumption that the observations are strictly stationary and ρ-mixing the asymptotic normality for the estimators of conditional expectiles is established by using the convexity lemma. For a large class of regression models, the ALS approach can be adapted to estimate the conditional percentiles directly. Further, we show that these ALS estimators for conditional percentiles are consistent. }

We suggest one possibility which has not been widely explored in the literature. It amounts to constructing bootstrap samples by resampling whole cross‐sectional units with replacement. In cases where the data do not exhibit cross‐sectional dependence but exhibit temporal dependence, such a resampling scheme is of great interest as it allows the application of i.i.d. bootstrap resampling rather than block bootstrap resampling. It is well known that the former enables superior approximation to distributions of statistics compared to the latter. We prove that the bootstrap based on cross‐sectional resampling provides asymptotic refinements. A Monte Carlo study illustrates the superior properties of the new resampling scheme compared to the block bootstrap.}",

While this entails easy interpretation of the estimated regression effects, it may often lead to incomplete analyses when more complex relationships are indeed present and also bears the risk of false conclusions about the significance/importance of covariates. We will therefore give an overview on extended types of regression models that allows us to go beyond mean regression. More specifically, we will consider generalized additive models for location, scale and shape as well as semiparametric quantile and expectile regression. We will review the basic properties of all three approaches and compare them with respect to the flexibility in terms of the supported types of predictor specification, the availability of software and the support for different types of inferential procedures.

 doi={10.18637/jss.v095.i01},
 abstract={Clustered covariances or clustered standard errors are very widely used to account for correlated or clustered data, especially in economics, political sciences, and other social sciences. They are employed to adjust the inference following estimation of a standard least-squares regression or generalized linear model estimated by maximum likelihood. Although many publications just refer to &amp;quot;the&amp;quot; clustered standard errors, there is a surprisingly wide variety of clustered covariances, particularly due to different flavors of bias corrections. Furthermore, while the linear regression model is certainly the most important application case, the same strategies can be employed in more general models (e.g., for zero-inflated, censored, or limited responses). In R, functions for covariances in clustered or panel models have been somewhat scattered or available only for certain modeling functions, notably the (generalized) linear regression model. In contrast, an object-oriented approach to &amp;quot;robust&amp;quot; covariance matrix estimation - applicable beyond lm() and glm() - is available in the sandwich package but has been limited to the case of cross-section or time series data. Starting with sandwich 2.4.0, this shortcoming has been corrected: Based on methods for two generic functions (estfun() and bread()), clustered and panel covariances are provided in vcovCL(), vcovPL(), and vcovPC(). Moreover, clustered bootstrap covariances are provided in vcovBS(), using model update() on bootstrap samples. These are directly applicable to models from packages including MASS, pscl, countreg, and betareg, among many others. Some empirical illustrations are provided as well as an assessment of the methods’ performance in a simulation study.},

We show that the optimal amount of attention is U-shaped in the return predictor, increasing with both uncertainty and the magnitude of the predictive coefficient and decreasing with stock-return volatility. The optimal risky asset position exhibits a negative hedging demand that is hump shaped in the return predictor. Its magnitude is larger when uncertainty increases but smaller when stock-return volatility increases.

We compare the response to earnings announcements on Friday, when investor inattention is more likely, to the response on other weekdays. If inattention influences stock prices, we should observe less immediate response and more drift for Friday announcements. Indeed, Friday announcements have a 15\% lower immediate response and a 70\% higher delayed response. A portfolio investing in differential Friday drift earns substantial abnormal returns. In addition, trading volume is 8\% lower around Friday announcements. These findings support explanations of post-earnings announcement drift based on underreaction to information caused by limited attention.},

We introduce the concept of attention comovement, which is the extent to which investor attention to a firm is explained by attention paid to the firm’s industry and the market in general. We find that attention comovement is nontrivial for the average firm and is related to firm characteristics, such as size and visibility. We also find that the comovement of investor attention has market consequences, in that it is positively associated with excess stock return comovement. Finally, we show that a firm’s earnings announcement contributes to the transfer of attention from one firm to its peer firms. Our results provide insights about the information flows underlying return comovement and aid in understanding the micro and macronature of investor attention.

augmenting the model with fundamental factors, momentum, idiosyncratic volatility, skewness,

However, it remained unanswered whether they preserve the convex transformation order of van Zwet, which is sometimes seen as a basic requirement for a measure of skewness. It is one of the aims of the present work to answer this question in the affirmative. These measures of skewness are scaled using interexpectile distances. We introduce orders of variability based on these quantities and show that the so-called weak expectile dispersive order is equivalent to the dilation order. Further, we analyze the statistical properties of empirical interexpectile ranges in some detail.}

The most popular of these skewness measures are based on the third centralized moment and on quantiles. However, there are major drawbacks in using these quantities. These include a strong emphasis on the distributional tails and a poor asymptotic behavior for the (empirical) moment-based measure as well as difficult statistical inference and strange behaviour for discrete distributions for quantile-based measures. Therefore, in this paper, we introduce skewness measures based on or connected with expectiles. Since expectiles can be seen as smoothed versions of quantiles, they preserve the advantages over the moment-based measure while not exhibiting most of the disadvantages of quantile-based measures. We introduce corresponding empirical counterparts and derive asymptotic properties. Finally, we conduct a simulation study, comparing the newly introduced measures with established ones, and evaluating the performance of the respective estimators.},

In this paper the issue of negative skewness is approached from a different angle to previous studies by combining the Trueman's 1997 model of management disclosure practices with symmetric market responses in order to explain negative skewness in stock returns. Empirical tests reveal that returns for days when non-scheduled news items are disclosed are the source of negative skewness in stock returns, as predicted. These findings suggest that negative skewness in stock returns is induced by asymmetries in the news disclosure policies of firm management. Furthermore, it is found that the returns are negatively skewed only for non-scheduled firm-specific news disclosures for firms where the management is compensated with stock options. }

Furthermore, the effect of attention is strongest among stocks with low institutional ownership and high idiosyncratic volatility. Our results are robust to the traditional “leverage effect” explanation of volatility asymmetry.

This relationship is asymmetric whereby changes in VIX are larger following negative news and/or stock market declines. Vector autoregression (VAR) analysis of the dynamics and cross-dependencies between variables reveals a strong positive relationship between previous and current period changes in implied volatility and stock returns, while current period and lagged news sentiment has a significant positive (negative) relationship with stock returns (changes in VIX). I develop a simple trading strategy whereby high (low) levels of implied volatility signal attractive opportunities to take short (long) positions in the underlying index, while extremely negative (positive) news sentiment signals opportunities to enter short (long) index positions.

abstract = {This study investigates the impacts of investor sentiments, including individual sentiment and market-wide sentiments, on time-varying risk-return tradeoffs in the U.S. stock market using quantile regressions. Empirical results show that the individual sentiment has a significant negative effect on the time-varying risk-return tradeoff across all quantiles, indicating the heterogeneity of the individual sentiment effect. Specifically, the positive individual sentiment weakens the time-varying risk-return tradeoff while the negative individual sentiment enhances it. Besides, there are asymmetric effects of the individual sentiment at quantiles (0.25, 0.75), that is, a negative individual sentiment associated with bad news has a stronger impact than a positive individual sentiment associated with good news. These findings are robust for alternative estimate methods and individual sentiments. However, the study finds that the time-varying risk-return tradeoff is less sensitive to the market-wide sentiment than to the individual sentiment, indicating that the individual sentiment is more useful and important in determining the stock price and variation.}

abstract = {ABSTRACT We study the influence of financial innovation by fintech brokerages on individual investors’ trading and stock prices. Using data from Robinhood, we find that Robinhood investors engage in more attention-induced trading than other retail investors. For example, Robinhood outages disproportionately reduce trading in high-attention stocks. While this evidence is consistent with Robinhood attracting relatively inexperienced investors, we show that it is also driven in part by the app's unique features. Consistent with models of attention-induced trading, intense buying by Robinhood users forecasts negative returns. Average 20-day abnormal returns are −4.7\% for the top stocks purchased each day.},

    abstract = "{Similar to a classic‐event study, this study examines market reaction to firmsa' earnings announcements. This study extends the examination to include a broad range of concurrent disclosure contained in earnings press releases: financial disclosure captured as accounting ratios; and verbal components of disclosure, both content and style, which are captured using elementary computer‐based content analysis. Extending the analysis to such a broad range of concurrent disclosures requires a methodology designed to utilize a large number of predictor variables, and predictive data mining algorithms are specifically designed to do so. Therefore, this study employs a widely used data‐mining algorithm—classification and regression trees (CART). Results of the study show that inclusion of predictor variables capturing verbal content and writing style of earnings‐press releases results in more accurate predictions of market response.}",
