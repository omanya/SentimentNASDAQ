## Investor opinion formation and the distribution of stock returns

### Abstract
We study how the distribution of stock returns is influenced by investor sentiment by applying expectile regression to abnormal returns. Distinguishing between the different aspects of investor opinion - investor perception, attention, and associated sentiment - we use firm- and time-specific proxies for each of these aspects. We consider purely financial indicators and scheduled and unscheduled events in an interplay with news sentiment. We find that the majority of the effects depend on the expectile level, which itself can be understood as the ’state of the world’ or ’extremeness level’ of abnormal returns. While not always significant for the mean regression, the proxies of the investment opinion show significant effects on the conditional distribution of abnormal returns beyond its mean. Our expectile regression approach allows us to naturally generalize previous studies of conditional mean regression to higher conditional moments and estimate the impact of investor opinion thereon. Significant impacts of positive and negative sentiment on the shape of the conditional return distribution are traced via expectile-based measures of dispersion and skewness. Moreover, using the relation of expectiles to expected shortfall, we consider the expected-shortfall-point of view and explore the significance of the effects on the conditional expected shortfall as well.
